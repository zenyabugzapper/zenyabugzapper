## 1. What is the Zenya Bug Zapper?

The Zenya Bug Zapper is a modern electric insect control device designed to attract and eliminate flying insects such as mosquitoes, flies, gnats, and moths. Utilizing ultraviolet (UV) light and an electrified grid, the zapper lures bugs and kills them instantly upon contact. Unlike chemical sprays and repellents, the Zenya Bug Zapper offers a safe, odorless, and environmentally friendly solution for both indoor and outdoor spaces.

### History of Bug Zappers

Bug zappers have been around since the early 20th century, with the first patented device appearing in 1934. Over the decades, technological improvements have made these devices safer, more efficient, and increasingly popular in homes and commercial establishments.

## 2. How Does the Zenya Bug Zapper Work?

The principle behind the Zenya Bug Zapper is straightforward yet highly effective. The device emits UV light, which is attractive to many flying insects. As bugs approach the light, they encounter an electrified metal grid. When they touch the grid, they receive a high-voltage shock that kills them instantly.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Attraction**: UV light draws insects to the device.
2. **Contact**: Bugs fly towards the light and touch the metal grid.
3. **Elimination**: A quick electric shock kills the insect.
4. **Collection**: Dead insects fall into a removable tray for easy disposal.
